# Malware-Assignment
This is a malware assignment under course Information Security.

#Assignments
Assignment 1: 
Taking cues from the code provided for AbraWorm.py, turn the FooVirus.py virus into a
worm by incorporating networking code in it.
The resulting worm will still infect only the ‘.foo’ files, but it will also have the ability to hop
into other machines.
You must show both folder to folder propagation (on the same machine) and VM to VM
propagation during the demo.
Assignment 2:
$ sudo apt-get update -y
$ sudo apt-get install python-paramiko
$ sudo apt-get install python-scp
Modify the code of the AbraWorm.py worm so that no two copies are exactly the same in all
of the infected hosts at any given time. One way to accomplish this would be by inserting
worm alteration code after the comment line that you see near the end of the main infinite
loop in the script. Finally, deposit a copy of AbraWorm.py at the target host.
The solution presented in the demo shows the modification of the AbraWorm file by:
● Adding new lines in random locations of the file
● Adding random character strings in comments
● Modifying the spaces between identifiers.
Any 2 modifications should be shown by the student. They can be different from the ones
mentioned.

# Overview
FooWorm is a Python script designed to demonstrate a simple worm that propagates through a network by infecting files with a ".foo" extension. The worm infects target hosts, copies itself to those hosts, and exfiltrates files to a designated host for analysis.

# Features
Infects files with a ".foo" extension on target hosts.

Checks for existing infections to avoid reinfection.

Copies itself to infected hosts for propagation.

Exfiltrates infected files to a designated host.

# Installation
Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.

Install the required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.

Update the usernames, passwds, and ipaddrs variables in the script to match your environment.

Run the script using python3 FooWorm.py.

# Usage
Execute the script on the machine where you want to start the propagation.

FooWorm will attempt to connect to the specified IP addresses using the provided credentials.

Once connected, it will search for files with a ".foo" extension and infect them if not already infected.

The worm will then copy itself to the infected host for further propagation.

If any infected files are found, they will be exfiltrated to a designated host for analysis.

# Configuration
usernames: List of usernames to try for SSH login.

passwds: List of passwords to try for SSH login.

ipaddrs: List of IP addresses of the target hosts.

# Notes
Ensure that the SSH credentials provided in the script have appropriate permissions for connecting to the target hosts.
Modify the script according to your network environment and security policies.

This script is for educational purposes only. Do not use it on unauthorized systems or networks.
