# Malware-Assignment
This is a malware assignment under course Information Security.
# Overview
FooWorm is a Python script designed to demonstrate a simple worm that propagates through a network by infecting files with a ".foo" extension. The worm infects target hosts, copies itself to those hosts, and exfiltrates files to a designated host for analysis.

# Features
Infects files with a ".foo" extension on target hosts.

Checks for existing infections to avoid reinfection.

Copies itself to infected hosts for propagation.

Exfiltrates infected files to a designated host.

# Installation
Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.

Install the required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.

Update the usernames, passwds, and ipaddrs variables in the script to match your environment.

Run the script using python3 FooWorm.py.

# Usage
Execute the script on the machine where you want to start the propagation.

FooWorm will attempt to connect to the specified IP addresses using the provided credentials.

Once connected, it will search for files with a ".foo" extension and infect them if not already infected.

The worm will then copy itself to the infected host for further propagation.

If any infected files are found, they will be exfiltrated to a designated host for analysis.

# Configuration
usernames: List of usernames to try for SSH login.

passwds: List of passwords to try for SSH login.

ipaddrs: List of IP addresses of the target hosts.

# Notes
Ensure that the SSH credentials provided in the script have appropriate permissions for connecting to the target hosts.
Modify the script according to your network environment and security policies.

This script is for educational purposes only. Do not use it on unauthorized systems or networks.
